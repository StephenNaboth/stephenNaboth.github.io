$$ A = CR $$, It expresses any matrix $$A$$ as a product of a matrix that describes its Column space $$C$$ and a matrix that describes its Row space $$R$$.
First, Matrix decompositions are interesting and important because we are able to represent complicated things as combination of simple things. 

We have different kinds of matrix decompostion such as lower-upper decomposition $$A=LU$$, eigendecompostion $$A = X\Lambda X^{-1}$$, singular value decomposition $$A = U\Sigma V^{T}$$ and QR decomposition $$A=QR$$. They all follow the same pattern, that is, we have acomplicated matrix on the left that has no structure in that we dont uncerstant what it is doing and it is represented as a product of simple matrices or highly structured matrices.
