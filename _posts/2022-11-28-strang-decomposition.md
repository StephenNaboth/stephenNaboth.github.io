Matrix decompositions are interesting and important because we are able to represent complicated things as combination of simple things. Strang decompostion, $$ A = CR $$, expresses any matrix $$A$$ as a product of a matrix that describes its Column space $$C$$ and a matrix that describes its Row space $$R$$.
 
There are various types of matrix decomposition, including lower-upper decomposition $$A=LU$$, eigendecomposition $$A = X\Lambda X^{-1}$$, singular value decomposition $$A = USigma V^{-T}$$, and QR decomposition $$A=QR$$. They all share the same structure, which is that the complicated matrix on the left is represented as the result of either simple matrices or matrices with a high degree of structure.
