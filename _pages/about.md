I grew up in Nairobi, Kenya, where I studied mathematics for my undergraduate degree at the University of Nairobi. Following that, I did my Master of Science in Mathematical Modelling in Engineering under the Mathmods program at the University of L'Aquila and the University in Hamburg. In my spare time, I enjoy connecting with friends on social media, gaming, and football.  I have a research interest in Mathematical Modeling, Optimization, FinTech, Machine learning, AI, HPC, and Cryptography.
