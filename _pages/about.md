Purpose of the website

My name is Stephen Naboth, a mathematician from Kenya with a Masters degree from Italy.  My passion for Applied Mathematics
began during my undergraduate studies. Since then, I have been working on research projects to enhance my professional skills
and to become a competent globalized mathematician. This site is to post blogs from mathematics to economics and other things
that interests me.

My hobbies include traveling, video games and getting involved in special projects that have a high impact in solving real world problems.
