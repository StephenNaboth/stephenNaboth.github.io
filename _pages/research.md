I was always fascinated by Numbers as a child. I made the decision to study Mathematics as a result. I started my studies in 
Kenya and afterwards pursued masters in mathematical modelig in Italy. My research interest are:

* PDEs
* Numerical approximations
* Machine Learning - AI
* Financial Mathematics
* Optimization
* Cybersecurity
